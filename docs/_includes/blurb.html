                    Docker for .NET Apps teaches you everything you need to know about running 
                    .NET apps in containers, with a practical real-world approach.
                </p>
                <p class="text-faded">
                    You'll start by learning the core Docker concepts: Dockerfiles, containers, 
                    images, registries and how to use containers on Windows and Linux.
                </p>
                <p class="text-faded">
                    Then you'll learn how to package and run .NET Framework and .NET Core apps 
                    in Docker, and how to design a distributed application around containers. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-faded"> 
                    Finally you'll learn how to get your containers ready for production, and you'll 
                    see what .NET apps look like in a production container platform.
